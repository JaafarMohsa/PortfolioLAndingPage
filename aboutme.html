      <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
        They call me, "Jaafar!"<br>Iâ€™m a web developer in Nairobi Kenya.I joined Moringa School to challenge myself and explore my passion for computers.<br>Previously, I have collected data needed to set up a website and application for our business company. I have also started,<strong>'Save Mamma'</strong>, a non-profit organisation that's basically aimed at lowering maternal death rates in Mandera County. I hope to create a website and an application for the my organisation by the end of my classes at Moringa. I know the basics of <em>Python, Javascript, and Bootstrap</em></p>
        <p>
        Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time with family and friends,
        taking photos, gaming, reading novels, swimming, playing & watching sports(basketball,football,tabletennis to name a few). I'm also pasionate about community service. I've volunterred at a couple of  humanitarian organizations like Red Cross Kenya. </p>
